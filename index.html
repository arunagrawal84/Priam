# TL;DR;


Priam is a process/tool that runs alongside [Apache Cassandra] (http://cassandra.apache.org), a highly available, column-oriented database. Priam automates following tasks:

* Backup and recovery (Complete and incremental)
* Token management
* Seed discovery
* Configuration

The name 'Priam' refers to the King of Troy in Greek mythology, who was the father of Cassandra. Priam is actively developed and used at Netflix.

##Features
* Token management using SimpleDB
* Support multi-region Cassandra deployment in AWS via public IP.
* Automated security group update in multi-region environment.
* Backup SSTables from local ephemeral disks to S3.
* Uses Snappy compression to compress backup data on the fly.
* Backup throttling
* Pluggable modules for future enhancements (support for multiple data storage).
* APIs to list and restore backup data.
* REST APIs for backup/restore and other operations

##Requirements
* Cloud support: AWS only
* Requires deployment of EC2 Instances behind an Auto Scaling Group(ASG). Ideally one ASG per datacenter.
* Supports one token per EC2 instance (no support for vnodes yet)
